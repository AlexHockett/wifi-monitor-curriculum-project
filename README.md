## Project Overview

As we all know by this point, the WiFi connection at UC Berkeley is rather unpredictable, and it can be downright frustrating when the network in certain parts of the campus suddenly goes down. 

Introducing our very own solution - the **UC Berkeley WiFi Monitor**!

We are building a dashboard where users can input their observations of WiFi signal strengths at different locations on campus and see the real-time network statuses on campus through a map view. 

More specifically, below are the key features of this dashboard:

1. Support user submissions, which include but aren't limited to the following fields:
- User location
- Signal strength
- Time of reporting

2. Support storage and retrieval of user-submitted data via connecting to the given backend application.

3. Compute an aggregate wifi strength score for different locations on campus based on user submissions.

4. Display aggregated scores for each location.

## Project Deliverables

The deliverable of this project is a **functional single-page React application** that supports the functionality criteria mentioned above.

8. If you decide to go with the map approach, import the Leaflet.js library and begin tinkering with the frameworks there. Following the [quickstart guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) is helpful here.

## Conclusion
This is quite a comprehensive documentation, but hopefully it provides you with a decent overview of the project and how to get started with frontend development as a whole. If you have any questions, please ask and seek help from your curriculum instructors. Have a great time building the WiFi Monitor!
